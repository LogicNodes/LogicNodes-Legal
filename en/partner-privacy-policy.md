# LogicNodes Platform - Privacy Policy

**Effective Date:** November 3, 2025

**Last Updated:** November 4, 2025  

## 1. Introduction

LogicNodes ("we," "our," or "us") provides an embeddable AI agent platform that enables businesses ("Partners") to integrate AI-powered automation into their products. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, store, and protect personal data when Partners integrate our platform into their products.

**Important:** If you are an end-user accessing LogicNodes through a Partner's product (e.g., Rackbeat, Shopify), your personal data is primarily controlled by the Partner. This policy explains LogicNodes' role as a **data processor** on behalf of the Partner (who is the **data controller**).

## 2. Roles & Responsibilities

### 2.1 Data Controller vs. Data Processor

**Partner (Data Controller):**
- Controls what personal data is collected
- Determines purposes and means of processing
- Responsible for obtaining user consent
- Must provide their own privacy policy to end-users

**LogicNodes (Data Processor):**
- Processes data on behalf of Partner
- Follows Partner's instructions via our API
- Implements security measures (encryption, access controls)
- Assists Partner with GDPR compliance (data deletion, export)

### 2.2 Your Rights (End-Users)

If you are an end-user accessing LogicNodes through a Partner's product:
-  **Right to access:** Request copy of your data
-  **Right to deletion:** Request deletion of your data
-  **Right to portability:** Export your data in machine-readable format
-  **Right to rectification:** Correct inaccurate data

**How to exercise rights:** Contact the Partner directly. They will instruct us to fulfill your request.

## 3. Data We Collect

### 3.1 Identity Data (via Partner)

When you access LogicNodes through a Partner's product, we receive:

| Data | Source | Purpose | Retention |
|------|--------|---------|-----------|
| Email address | Partner JWT | Account identification, notifications | Until deletion |
| Full name | Partner JWT | Display in UI | Until deletion |
| Organization ID | Partner JWT | Multi-tenant isolation | Until deletion |
| Organization name | Partner JWT (optional) | Display in UI | Until deletion |
| Partner user ID | Partner JWT | Link to Partner account | Until deletion |

**Legal Basis (GDPR):** Legitimate interest (providing service to Partner), Contractual necessity

### 3.2 Usage Data

When you use AI agents through our platform:

| Data | Purpose | Retention | Can Delete? |
|------|---------|-----------|-------------|
| Agent run history | Conversation continuity, debugging | 1-90 days (configurable) |  Yes (automatic) |
| API requests/responses | Agent execution context | 1-90 days (configurable) |  Yes (automatic) |

| Voice transcriptions | Process voice input | 1-90 days (configurable) |  Yes (automatic) |
| Uploaded files | Agent input data | 1-90 days (configurable) |  Yes (automatic) |

**Legal Basis (GDPR):** Legitimate interest (service functionality), Contractual necessity

### 3.3 Authentication Data

| Data | Purpose | Retention | Can Delete? |
|------|--------|-----------|-------------|

-  Social security numbers or government IDs
-  Health information (unless Partner explicitly provides it)
-  Financial account numbers

## 4. How We Use Data

### 4.1 Service Provision

We use your data to:
-  Authenticate you via Partner JWT
-  Execute AI agents on your behalf
-  Display conversation history
-  Process voice input (transcription)
-  Store execution context for multi-turn conversations

### 4.2 Security & Fraud Prevention

We use your data to:
-  Detect unauthorized access attempts
-  Monitor for API abuse
-  Investigate security incidents
-  Comply with security audit requirements

### 4.3 Service Improvement

We use aggregated, anonymized data to:
-  Analyze feature usage
-  Optimize performance
-  Improve AI agent accuracy

**Note:** We do NOT use your personal data for AI model training (LLM providers you configure may have their own policies).

### 4.4 Legal Compliance

We may use/disclose data to:
-  Comply with legal obligations (subpoenas, court orders)
-  Enforce our Terms of Service
-  Protect our rights and safety
-  Respond to lawful government requests

## 5. Data Sharing & Disclosure

### 5.1 With Partners

**Your data belongs to the Partner.** We share:
-  Agent execution results (via API responses)
-  Usage metrics (run counts, error rates)
-  We do NOT share data across different Partners

### 5.2 With Sub-Processors

We use trusted third-party services. **Complete list:** /en/subprocessors

**Summary:**

| Sub-Processor | Service | Data Shared | Location | Safeguards |
|---------------|---------|-------------|----------|------------|
| **Supabase Inc.** | Database, Auth, Storage | All data | EU data hosting (AWS EU-North-1, Stockholm); entity domicile outside the EEA may apply | GDPR DPA, SCC (relies on SOC 2/ISO 27001 certified infrastructure: AWS) |
| **Vercel Inc.** | Web & Edge Hosting | Technical data, session data | EU (Frankfurt) | GDPR DPA, SCC |
| **Render Inc.** | Backend Hosting & APIs | All data | EU (Frankfurt) | EU-US DPF, GDPR DPA, SCC |
| **Mailgun Technologies Inc. (Sinch)** | Transactional emails | Email, name | USA/EU (routing-dependent) | SOC 2 Type I & II, ISO 27001, GDPR DPA, SCC |
| **OpenAI LLC** | AI Model Inference (LLM) | Agent prompts, responses | Global / USA | SOC 2 Type II, GDPR DPA, SCC |
| **Anthropic PBC** | AI Model Inference (LLM) | Agent prompts, responses | Global / USA | SOC 2, GDPR DPA, SCC |
| **Google Cloud Platform** | AI Model Inference (Gemini) | Agent prompts, responses | EU / Global | SOC 2, ISO 27001, GDPR DPA, SCC |
| **xAI Corp.** | AI Model Inference (Grok) | Agent prompts, responses | Global / USA | GDPR DPA, SCC |

**Sub-Processor Agreements:** All sub-processors have signed Data Processing Agreements (DPAs) with adequate GDPR safeguards.

**Sub-Processors of Sub-Processors:** Each sub-processor may engage their own sub-processors (e.g., Supabase uses AWS; Vercel and Render use AWS/Google Cloud). These are covered under respective vendor DPAs.

### 5.3 With LLM Providers

**Default Configuration:**
By default, LogicNodes provides API keys for LLM services (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, xAI). In this configuration:
- LLM providers are our sub-processors (listed above)
- We maintain DPAs with all LLM providers
- We disable provider-side training and retention where configurable
- All data processing is covered under our DPA with the Partner

**Optional: Partner-Provided API Keys**
Partners may provide their own LLM API keys. In this configuration:
- Partner contracts directly with the LLM provider
- LLM provider becomes Partner's direct processor (not our sub-processor)
- Partner is responsible for their own DPA with the LLM provider
- Partners should review LLM provider privacy policies and enforce no-training, no-retention settings

### 5.4 No Sale of Personal Data

We do NOT sell, rent, or trade personal data to third parties. Ever.

## 6. Data Retention & Deletion

### 6.1 Automatic Retention Policies

| Data Type | Retention | Deletion Method |
|-----------|-----------|-----------------|
| Agent runs | 1-90 days (Partner-configurable) | Automatic daily cleanup |
| Agent run events | 1-90 days (Partner-configurable) | Automatic daily cleanup |
| Transcriptions | 1-90 days (Partner-configurable) | Automatic daily cleanup |
| Audit logs | 1 year (fixed) | Automatic after 1 year |
| User account data | Until deletion request | Manual or Partner-initiated |

**Cleanup Schedule:** Daily at 2:00 AM UTC

### 6.2 User-Initiated Deletion
