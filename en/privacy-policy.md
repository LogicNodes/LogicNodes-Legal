## 1. Introduction

LogicNodes ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains our practices regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of information when you use our services.

**Our Privacy Commitment:** We believe in minimal data collection. We only collect what is absolutely necessary to provide our services, and we retain data for the shortest period possible.

## 2. Information We Collect

### 2.1 Authentication Information

To provide you with access to our services, we collect only the following information necessary for account authentication:

- **Email address** - Used as your unique identifier and for account-related communications
- **Password** - Stored securely using industry-standard encryption (we never store passwords in plain text)
- **Authentication tokens** - Temporary session tokens to keep you logged in

### 2.2 Information We Do NOT Collect

Unlike many services, we do not collect:

- Personal identifying information beyond your email address
- Behavioral tracking data
- Analytics or usage patterns for marketing purposes
- Third-party cookies or tracking pixels
- Device fingerprinting data
- Location data

## 3. How We Use Your Information

We use the minimal information we collect solely for the following purposes:

- **Authentication** - To verify your identity and provide secure access to your account
- **Service delivery** - To enable the core functionality of our platform
- **Security** - To protect your account from unauthorized access
- **Essential communications** - To send critical service updates, security alerts, or responses to your inquiries (we do not send marketing emails)

We do not use your information for advertising, profiling, or any secondary purposes.

## 4. Data Retention

We practice aggressive data minimization with the following retention policies:

- **Session data** - Deleted upon logout or session expiration
- **Temporary data** - Automatically purged on a daily basis according to our data retention policies
- **Authentication data** - Retained only while your account is active
- **Account deletion** - Upon account deletion, all associated data is immediately removed from production systems and purged from backups within 30 days

You may request deletion of your account and all associated data at any time by contacting us at privacy@logicnodes.ai.

## 5. Information Sharing and Disclosure

We do not sell, rent, trade, or otherwise share your personal information with third parties, except in the following limited circumstances:

### 5.1 With Your Consent

We will share your information only when you explicitly authorize us to do so.

### 5.2 Legal Requirements

We may disclose your information if required by law, court order, or governmental authority, or when we believe in good faith that such disclosure is necessary to:

- Comply with legal obligations
- Protect our rights, property, or safety
- Investigate fraud or security issues
- Protect against legal liability

### 5.3 Service Providers

We may use trusted third-party service providers to help operate our services (such as hosting infrastructure). These providers are contractually bound to:

- Use your data only for the specific services they provide to us
- Maintain the same level of data protection as outlined in this policy
- Delete or return data when their services are no longer needed

We do not share data with advertising networks, analytics companies, or data brokers.

## 6. Data Security

We implement industry-standard security measures to protect your information:

- **Encryption** - All data is encrypted in transit (TLS/SSL) and at rest
- **Access controls** - Strict internal access policies limit who can access user data
- **Secure authentication** - Passwords are hashed and salted using bcrypt or similar algorithms
- **Regular security audits** - We continuously monitor and improve our security practices
- **Minimal data exposure** - By collecting minimal data, we minimize potential exposure in the event of a breach

While we take reasonable precautions, no method of transmission over the internet is 100% secure. We cannot guarantee absolute security.

## 7. Your Rights and Choices

You have the following rights regarding your personal information:

### 7.1 Access and Portability

You may request a copy of the personal information we hold about you at any time.

### 7.2 Correction

You may update or correct your email address through your account settings or by contacting us.

### 7.3 Deletion

You may request deletion of your account and all associated data at any time. We will delete data immediately from production systems and purge from backups within 30 days.

### 7.4 Data Minimization

We automatically minimize data retention. Temporary data is purged daily without requiring action on your part.

### 7.5 Opt-Out

You may opt out of non-essential communications at any time. Note that we may still send critical service-related notifications necessary for account security.

## 8. International Data Transfers

If you access our services from outside the jurisdiction where our servers are located, your information may be transferred across international borders. We ensure that any such transfers comply with applicable data protection laws and maintain the same level of protection described in this policy.

## 9. Children's Privacy

Our services are not intended for individuals under the age of 13 (or the applicable age of digital consent in your jurisdiction). We do not knowingly collect information from children. If we learn that we have collected information from a child, we will delete it immediately.
